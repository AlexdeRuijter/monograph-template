\section{Notation}
Throughout this note, the set of natural numbers, the set of integers, the set of non-negative integers, the set of real numbers, $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, the set of $n$ by $m$ matrices, and the set of $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrices are respectively denoted by $\Nbb$, $\Zbb$, $\Zbb_+$, $\Rbb$, $\Rbb^n$, $\Rbb^{n \times m}$, and $\Sbb^n$.
Also, the cone of positive semi-definite of matrices in $\Sbb^n$ is denoted by $\Sbb_+^n$. The interior of $\Sbb_+^n$ is denoted by $\Sbb_{++}^n$, that is exactly the set of positive definite matrices.
